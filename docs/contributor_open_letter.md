# Open letter to developers

"The water in the spring river is warm, duck prophet, it's the time when the pufferfish is about to come!"

Dear friend, I am John, a Java programmer in an ordinary company. Today, with a very sincere heart, I send this open letter to you who love AI technology and innovation.

Half a year ago, I saw many excellent projects, such as `Dify`, `Chat2DB` and other artificial intelligence-related projects. I was thinking, it would be great if I could participate in these projects. Unfortunately, "there is no way to serve the country, and I have been coding for ten years in vain."

I came across the video of the Xiage team in early 2025. I was very curious about how they achieved it. I wanted to copy their back-end service and create a low-cost civilian Jarvis. It's a pity that the work we are doing now is still just an artificial retardation, with low concurrency, no soul, slow response and many bugs.

The Xiage team is what we learn from. I really want to have a Xiaozhi backend service that is as smart as the Xiage team. But I can also understand Brother Xia’s decision not to open source. "One flower blooming alone is not spring, but a hundred flowers blooming together fill the garden." The era when artificial intelligence is blooming everywhere may be realized in our generation. We can use our own hands to realize low-cost civilian Jarvis. I personally think that what he can achieve, we can also achieve, it is just a matter of time. I call it "our path of learning."

So what difficulties will we encounter on this path of learning? I think it should be no less than eighty-one. There will inevitably be various monsters along the way. Of course, there are also gods who help us secretly, and there are also people who join the team to learn the scriptures.

If the above sounds funny to you. Then I feel very lucky. If I can make you laugh for five seconds in your more than 30,000 days of life, it can be regarded as a contribution to you.

I don’t know if the idea of ​​low-cost Jarvis for civilian use will fail, but isn’t this kind of failure very common in the lives of ordinary people like us?

In the future, one thing is certain, there will be someone who will completely replicate the functions of Brother Xiazhi’s team and realize low-cost Jarvis for civilian use. Will this project be ours?

We look forward to working with you hand in hand to create a better future.

John, 2025.3.11, Guangzhou

# Attached Development Contribution Guidelines
## Project goals

1. **Low-cost Jarvis solution for civilian use**

2. **Intelligent linkage peripheral hardware solutions**

## Join us

We warmly welcome like-minded friends to join us and contribute to the project together. You can check out the functions we want to implement in the near future at [this link](https://github.com/users/xinnan-tech/projects/3). Those in the function list that have not been assigned relevant personnel to handle are those that urgently need your participation. Here’s how to participate:

### 1. Become a regular contributor

Fork the project, submit a PR, and merge it into the main branch after being reviewed by the developers.

### 2. Become a developer

After you have submitted a total of 3 valid PRs, you can contact the group owner to apply to become a developer. The group owner will invite you to join an independent developer group to discuss the future of the project.

## Developer development process

1. **Create a new branch**
Each function point should be developed as a new branch. The branch name should be concise and clear, so that people can see the implemented function at a glance and avoid function collision.

2. **Submit PR for review**
After the function development is completed, please submit a PR on GitHub, which will be reviewed by other developers. After passing the review, it will be merged into the main branch.
